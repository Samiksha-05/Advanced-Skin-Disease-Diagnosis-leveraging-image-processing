    <h2>How It Works</h2>
Our Skin Disease Detection Tool is designed to provide users with a quick, informative assessment of potential skin conditions through a simple and user-friendly process.

Image Upload and Preparation

Start by uploading a clear photo of the affected skin area. Good lighting and a clear focus help ensure accurate results.
The tool then refines the image to remove any unnecessary background, focusing solely on the visible skin condition for precise evaluation.
Image Analysis and Condition Comparison

Using a comprehensive set of reference images and information about various skin conditions, the tool compares your uploaded image to known visual patterns associated with common skin issues.
Based on this analysis, it identifies potential conditions that may match the appearance of the skin area you uploaded.
Detailed Report and Recommendations

The tool generates a preliminary report that includes possible conditions along with descriptions, common symptoms, and suggested next steps.
This report helps users understand what the skin condition might be and encourages them to consult a healthcare provider for a detailed examination and personalized advice.
Privacy and Security

Your privacy is a top priority. All images and data are processed securely, with no information stored or shared without your permission. This ensures a safe and confidential experience for every user.
Our Purpose
Our goal is to make early skin health assessments more accessible and to encourage users to seek timely medical advice for their conditions. By providing an initial assessment, we empower users to take informed steps toward managing their skin health.

Disclaimer
This tool offers preliminary insights but is not a replacement for medical diagnosis. We recommend consulting a qualified healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options.
